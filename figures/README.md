#Figures directory content

This directory contains all the important figures created by Hugo during
his project. It is seperated in three directories. 

## most_important_figures

This subdirectory contains all of the capital plots. This includes all 
the final 2D parameter space analysis plots send by slack to Paul Laplante
and James Auguire. It also includes plots judged of capital importance to the
understanding of the repo, such as corner plots of the best-fitted parameters
and plots used in presentations. The folder also contains bt_map, a subfolder
containing the final power spectrum of brightness temperature for the 2D range 
in parameter space for all 3 models (see GIF in folder).

## other_figures

This subdirectory contains all the other plots that were judged useful to 
keep, but doesn't fit the criteria upward mentioned

##GIF_observables 

This contains all the made GIF that are judged useful to visualization. There
are many, because I have a weird passion for them.
